# 🔭 Vision

Humans are learners by nature. But the competition faced by the generation leads to rank centric learning rather than education and skill. MySchool challenges this status quo by giving educators the building blocks of personal analysis - teacher feedback, efficient assessment, class room graphs — and the flexibility to combine them to bring new measures of teaching.

We believe that by equipping educators with the best tools to tackle their challenges, we can solve the whole world's problems better, together. ✌️
