# ***A tale of tools and the prospect of education***

Most of us spend most of the months at work, in front of a computer. The device that boosts the memory, retention and productivity. Makes tasks simpler. Modern. Better.

Yet the educators use the traditional manual approach to education and performance; focusing on the theoretical rote assessment based on reproducing the textbooks. 

But have you ever thought why these methods still exists and how we created MySchool. 

These traditions come from the education boards that existed before the computer came into personal lives. Education boards developed curicular for students to think critically and power inquire. Aimed to make them better learners. 

The educator consults a few number of students with the most minimal curriculum one might ever see. Slowly the curricular increased due to the technological advancements. To solve the existing and future problems, it demand more skilled and versatile knowledge base, which increased the depth and width of the curriculum. 

This paved the way for industries and technological advancements we know today. 

A tool unlike anything we have seen before, A Computer, came into everyday life.

A number crunching machine evolved rendering more complex mathematical calculations which we today as Google converted the internet into a huge knowledge base, Microsoft developed electronic and versatile typewriters with the Microsoft Office Suit providing documents, spreadsheets and graphs, presentations, and electronic mail, Apple miniaturized the computer to fit it into our pockets and accessible at anytime. We are surrounded by computer and the services it gives. 

But educators are deprived of that calculative technology and follow the traditional methods of evaluation.

Education became more important. An increase in schools and colleges was demanded with more seats than ever before; making the educators lost in assignments, curriculum, students, self development and so on. Making it difficult to track the personal and individual student's progress through the curriculum theoretically and practically.

That's where MySchool comes in. We want to bring an effective analytical system to make educators focus on the content they deliver to the class as a whole rather than to an individual.

The educator is blended into a system that helps in monitoring individual performances of students, class performance and a feedback system for teacher and student's performance. This helps the teacher focus more on weak topics, self improve methods to teach and connect to teachers and trainers to help effective delivery of content to the learners.

The educator is given feedback based on the class by active learners and also gets feedbacks by an expert on improving ways to deliver custom content to learners and help prosper.
